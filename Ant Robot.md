# ATTA
Embedded Systems Project

## Quick description
This project is about building and programing an ant-like robot

## Scope

### What the system must have:
- 3 motors for each leg
  - 1 for hight control
  - 2 for walking movement (lift + translation)

### What the system must do:
- Mimic the walking movement of a real ant

### Optionals (plus to the project):
- Control via bluetooth
- Installation of a tail to transform the robot into a scorpion
- Program new movements for the tail

Up to now,  we have the following IO requirements for the GPIO (still need to verify availability on the Viola Base Board
  1. 18 Output - motors
